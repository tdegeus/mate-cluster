# 1. Transfer to node
# ===================

# create temp directory

# typically in the home directory on the head-node
cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}
# copy input files

# change directory to the temporary directory on the compute-node
cd $computedir

# 2. Execute
# ==========

# create a file with the hostname in the folder from which the 
# PBS-script was submitted
echo `hostname` > ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}/computenode.txt

# a simple script (replace by your commands)
echo "Hello world"

# 3. Transfer back to the head-node
# =================================

# change to directory to the home directory (on the head-node)
cd "${PBS_O_WORKDIR}"
# copy everything from the compute-node
cp -prf "${computedir}"/* .
# erase the temp directory on compute-node
rm -rf "$computedir"
