   The content presented here is meant as example, some adaptation to a specific application is usually needed. We take no responsibility for the loss of data or damage caused by using any of the matter discussed here.

This manual is intended as a starting point for people who want to use (the MaTe) clusters. Typically these clusters run on Linux and make use of a queuing system to assign jobs of (different) users over its resources. This manual discusses the :ref:`page-queuing`, including some :ref:`languages`. A basic knowledge of :ref:`sec-linux` and :ref:`sec-bash` is assumed. For those unfamiliar with them an introduction covering the basics is included in :ref:`sec-linux` and :ref:`sec-bash`, respectively.

Note that in any programming languages (including Linux/Bash) there are many ways of doing the same thing, and the choice is usually very subjective. We only presented several examples, complemented with pointers on how to learn more.
